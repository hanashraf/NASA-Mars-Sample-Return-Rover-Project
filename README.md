# NASA-Mars-Sample-Return-Rover-Project
n this project, we’ll do computer vision for robotics. We are going to build a Sample &amp; Return Rover in simulation. Mainly, we’ll control the robot from images streamed from a camera mounted on the robot. The project aims to do autonomous mapping and navigation given an initial map of the environment.
